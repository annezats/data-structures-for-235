the remove function only works if the node to be deleted has no children
it encounters problems if the parent of the node to be deleted has one child and one nullptr
tree.cpp line 108 is where the issue is, because if either of the nodes are nullptrs it wont work
it took me a while to figure it out and now that i know the issue i have ideas on how to fix it but i havent done them yet
because all my ideas involve convoluted things of nested conditionals
